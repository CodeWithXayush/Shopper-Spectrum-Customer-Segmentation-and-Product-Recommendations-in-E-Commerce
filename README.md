# *Project Title*
Shopper Spectrum: Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendations in E-Commerce

# Project Overview
Analyze e-commerce transaction data.

Segment customers using RFM analysis and clustering.

Recommend products via collaborative filtering.

Deploy interactive web app using Streamlit.

# Skills Used
Data Preprocessing with Pandas & Numpy

EDA & Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

RFM Feature Engineering

Machine Learning: Clustering (KMeans), Model Evaluation

Collaborative Filtering (Cosine Similarity)

Streamlit Web App

# Problem Statement
The project addresses the need to analyze transaction data to:

Discover customer segments for targeted marketing.

Build a recommendation engine to boost sales and retention.

Inform business strategies with actionable insights.

# Step-by-Step Process :
Step 1: Dataset Collection & Understanding
Download the dataset (if not shareable, provide link/instructions).

Explore structure, datatypes

Check for missing values, duplicates, anomalies

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Remove rows where CustomerID is missing

Exclude cancelled invoices (InvoiceNo starting with ‘C’)

Drop rows with negative/zero Quantity or UnitPrice

Step 3: EDA
Analyze and visualize:

Transaction volume by country

Top-selling products

Purchase trends over time

Monetary distribution

RFM distributions

Elbow curve for cluster number

Cluster profiles

Product similarity heatmap

Step 4: Feature Engineering (RFM)
Recency: Days since last purchase

Frequency: Number of purchases

Monetary: Total spend

Standardize/normalize RFM

Step 5: Clustering
Algorithm: KMeans (or DBSCAN, Hierarchical)

Decide clusters: Elbow method, silhouette score

Fit model & label clusters: e.g., High-Value, Regular, Occasional, At-Risk

Visualize clusters (2D/3D)

Step 6: Recommendation System
Item-based collaborative filtering

Build Customer/Product matrix

Compute similarity (cosine similarity)

Recommend top-5 similar products

Step 7: Streamlit Web App
Product Recommender: Input product name → get 5 recommendations

Customer Segment Predictor: Input R, F, M → get segment label

User-friendly interface
